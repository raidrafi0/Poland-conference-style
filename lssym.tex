\section{Conclusion}
A deep reinforcement neural network is established for road tracking termed the DRL-RT. This network is suggested to guide driving cars under different weather environments. Different tracking instances were coded to represent the appropriate road tracking. The MDP concept is used here, where the network accepted states and produced actions by taking advantages from rewards. The proposed deep reinforcement network is based on the policy search. This study were compared with other work and it reported superior performance. In addition, interesting results were benchmarked by the proposed approach. That is, the best performance of 93.94\% was recorded for a clear environment and reasonable performance were reported under unclear environments of fog, rain and heavy-rain as the obtained accuracies were respectively equal to 93.66\%, 89.55\% and 84.68\%.
